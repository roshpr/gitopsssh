# gitoopsOverSsh

`gitoopsOverSsh` is a Go-based tool for monitoring file integrity on remote servers. It ensures that files on your servers match the versions stored in a central Git repository.

## Architecture

The application is composed of the following main components:

*   **Poller:** Periodically checks the file integrity on each server.
*   **Git Manager:** Manages the local clone of the Git repository.
*   **SSH Client:** Connects to remote servers to check file hashes.
*   **Store:** A SQLite database that stores the application's state, including servers, monitored files, and file state history.
*   **HTTP Server:** Provides a simple web-based UI to view the status of monitored files.

## What we are doing

`gitoopsOverSsh` addresses the problem of configuration drift in a server infrastructure. It ensures that the files on your servers are in the desired state, as defined by a Git repository. This is achieved by:

1.  **Cloning a Git repository:** The application maintains a local clone of a Git repository that contains the desired state of your monitored files.
2.  **Polling servers:** It periodically connects to each configured server via SSH.
3.  **Comparing file hashes:** For each monitored file, it calculates the hash of the local version (from the Git repository) and the remote version (on the server). 
4.  **Reporting status:** If the hashes don't match, the file is marked as "drifted." The status of all monitored files is displayed in a web UI.

## How to set up the environment

### Development

1.  **Install Go:** Make sure you have Go installed and configured on your system.
2.  **Install SQLite:** `gitoopsOverSsh` uses SQLite as its database. Install it using your system's package manager:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y sqlite3
    ```
3.  **Configure `config.yml`:** See the `config.yml` details section below.
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    CGO_ENABLED=1 go run cmd/gitoopsoverssh/main.go
    ```

### Development with Docker and Make

For a more streamlined development experience, you can use the provided `Makefile` and `Dockerfile`.

#### Building and Running with Make

The `Makefile` provides several useful commands:

*   `make build`: Compiles your application.
*   `make run`: Runs the compiled application.
*   `make clean`: Removes the compiled application binary.
*   `make help`: Displays a list of all available commands.

#### Building and Running with Docker

The `Dockerfile` allows you to build and run the application in a containerized environment.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    make docker-build
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    make docker-run
    ```
    This will start the application and expose the web UI on port 8080 of your host machine.

**Note:** The `Dockerfile` assumes that your main Go source file is located at `cmd/gitoopsoverssh/main.go`. If this is not the case, you will need to update the `Dockerfile` and `Makefile` accordingly. It also copies the `config.yml` file and the `internal/store/migrations` directory, so make sure they exist before building the docker image.

### Deployment

1.  **Build the binary:**
    ```bash
    CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o gitoopsoverssh cmd/gitoopsoverssh/main.go
    ```
2.  **Deploy the binary and `config.yml`:** Copy the `gitoopsoverssh` binary and your `config.yml` file to your server.
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./gitoopsoverssh
    ```

## How to view the UI

Once the application is running, you can view the UI by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080` (or the appropriate address if you're running it on a remote server).

## `config.yml` details

The `config.yml` file is the central configuration for the application. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

```yaml
git:
  remote: "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
  branch: "main"
  repoPath: "/tmp/gitoops_repo"
  refreshIntervalSeconds: 300

polling:
  intervalSeconds: 60
  maxConcurrency: 10

products:
  - id: "product-a"
    name: "Product A"
    global:
      sshKeyPath: "/path/to/your/ssh/key"
    servers:
      - id: "server-1"
        name: "Server 1"
        host: "1.2.3.4"
        port: 22
        user: "user"
        sudo: true
    files:
      - dest: "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
        repoRelPath: "nginx/nginx.conf"
```
